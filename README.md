This repository accompanies the talk I gave at [Scalabase](https://www.scalabaseconf.com/) on 14 May 2021.

## Running the code

You'll need sbt installed. Within the root of this directory, run

```
sbt run
```

You may also want to start an sbt console:

```
sbt
```

and run the app continuously as you make changes:

```
sbt:scalabase-talk> ~run
```
