# Generating Data Models with Scalameta

This repository accompanies the talk I gave at [Scalabase](https://www.scalabaseconf.com/) on 14 May 2021.

[Watch the conference talks here](https://vimeo.com/547654644/57a3ab2e82) (my talk is introduced around 2h 37). <!-- TODO: Youtube? -->

## Running the code

You'll need sbt installed. Within the root of this directory, run

```
sbt run
```

You may also want to start an sbt console:

```
sbt
```

and run the app continuously as you make changes:

```
sbt:scalabase-talk> ~run
```
